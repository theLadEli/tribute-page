                    <p>
                        Mark Twain, whose real name is Samuel Langhorne Clemens, was born on November 30, 1835, in
                        Florida,
                        Missouri. He is known as one of America's most cherished authors and humorists. Growing up along
                        the Mississippi River, Twain was deeply influenced by the culture and people of the region,
                        which
                        would later become central themes in his writing.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Twain's most famous works, The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (1876) and Adventures of Huckleberry
                        Finn
                        (1884), are considered classics of American literature, celebrated for their vivid depictions of
                        youth, adventure, and social commentary. His sharp wit and keen observations on human nature
                        have
                        earned him a lasting place in the literary world.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Beyond his novels, Twain was a prolific essayist, journalist, and lecturer, known for his
                        satirical
                        style and ability to address serious social issues with humour. He traveled widely and often
                        drew
                        upon his experiences in his writing, making his work both entertaining and thought-provoking.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Mark Twain passed away on April 21, 1910, but his legacy lives on through his enduring
                        contributions
                        to literature and his influence on writers around the world. His work continues to be read,
                        studied,
                        and loved by readers of all ages, making him a timeless figure in American culture.
